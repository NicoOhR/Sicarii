Motor racing as a sport is what I would call statistics-adjacent. In the same way that a baseball game, or an entire series, can be recreated from the key measures of players, the *story* of a race can be told almost entierly from the statistics. The ups and downs and emotional highs of a race, of course, can't quite be quantified (yet), but the macro image of a driver, of their personality and strategy and legacy, is told in half floats entries on a CSV. 

Despite this, of course, FSAE provides the results of the yearly competition in a PDF format, which I would say is almost hostile to any form of analysis. And if it's hostile to excel-spreadsheet-accountant type data analysis, it is outright aggressive towards any attempts to do any data *science* with it.
