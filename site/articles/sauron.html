      <p>This will be a very brief overview of our 2024 HackUTD hackathon
project. There were a couple of very interesting sponsor prompts, and
I’m still a little sad we never got the chance to use Pinata, we
ultimately went with PNC’s prompt, to build tooling for observability
and data lifetimes. Of course, the word “observability” and “lifetimes”
immediately caused us to think of Kafka. So, for our project, we decided
to build a platform to model and display our end to end life cycle of
our data cleanly and efficiently. To that end, with only one all-nighter
pulled. We produced <code>Sauron</code> (a very clever name I came up
with my self, thank you very much). <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM_0w7rKo2c">Here is a link of a
demo</a> that due to time constraints we had to make before we could
fully hook it up the Confluents instance that we were simulating our ETL
on. <a href="git@github.com:NicoOhR/sauron.git">And here is the GitHub
repo</a></p>
<p>Briefly, we used Terraform to spin up a Confluents instance, as well
as several small python cli programs (orchestrated over k8) which acted
as modular consumer-producers to simulate micro-services in our
pipeline. We utilized some minimal (and very under documented)
OpenTelemetry python instrumentation, written directly into the service,
which hooked up to a Jaeger instance (also deployed on k8). Finally, we
somehow (I was asleep) relayed the Jaeger data into our front end, which
you could see in the video.</p>
<p>Overall it was a very good, although exhausting hackathon, and we
produced a very interesting project. I learned a lot, and was definitely
the most hands on experience that I’ve had with Kafka.</p>
