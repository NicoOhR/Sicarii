      <div class="text"><p>This will be a very brief overview of our 2024 HackUTD hackathon project.
There were a couple of very interesting sponsor prompts, and I'm still
a little sad we never got the chance to use Pinata, we ultimately went
with PNC's prompt, to build tooling for observability and data lifetimes.
Of course, the word &quot;observability&quot; and &quot;lifetimes&quot; immediately caused us
to think of Kafka. So, for our project, we decided to build a platform to
model and display our end to end life cycle of our data cleanly and
efficiently. To that end, with only one all-nighter pulled. We produced
<code>Sauron</code> (a very clever name I came up with my self, thank you very
much). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM_0w7rKo2c">Here is a link of
a demo</a> that due to time
constraints we had to make before we could fully hook it up the Confluents
instance that we were simulating our ETL on. <a href="">And here is the GitHub repo</a></p>
<p>Briefly, we used Terraform to spin up a Confluents instance, as well as
several small python cli programs (orchestrated over k8) which acted as
modular consumer-producers to simulate micro-services in our pipeline. We
utilized some minimal (and very under documented) OpenTelemetry python
instrumentation, written directly into the service, which hooked up to
a Jaeger instance (also deployed on k8). Finally, we somehow (I was
asleep) relayed the Jaeger data into our front end, which you could see in
the video.</p>
<p>Overall it was a very good, although exhausting hackathon, and we produced
a very interesting project. I learned a lot, and was definitely the most
hands on experience that I've had with Kafka.</p>
