To start, FSAE (Formula: Student Automotive Engineer) is a worldwide
competition aimed primarily at giving university students a competition to
exercise and apply the skills which they learn in the classroom. The
competition is aimed predominantly at Mechanical Engineering, and in
recent years with the advent of the EV competition, Electrical Engineering
majors. By way of demand, however, the FSAE chapter at UT Dallas, a school
overfilled with Computer Science Majors, several large software and
firmware projects. Here I focus on the project which I have spent the most
time on, the Data Acquisition Device (colloquially, NoTeC, a joke I will
explain later) and will hopefully circle back to the other projects later.
